    <meta name="description" content="The Tradescantia Nanouk, scientifically known as Tradescantia albiflora &#39;Nanouk&#39;, is a horticultural masterpiece that has taken the indoor gardening world by storm with its almost ethereal, candy-colored foliage. Developed in the Netherlands in 2012 through a rigorous breeding program, this patented cultivar was specifically designed to be more robust, compact, and vibrantly colored than its older &#34;Spiderwort&#34; or &#34;Inch Plant&#34; relatives. Its leaves are its crowning glory: thick, lance-shaped, and slightly waxy, they feature a stunning variegated pattern of creamy white, sage green, and brilliant fuchsia stripes. Perhaps most striking is the underside of each leaf, which is a solid, vivid magenta that creates a glowing effect when the plant is viewed from below in a hanging basket. Unlike many of its trailing cousins that can become sparse and spindly, the Nanouk has shorter internodes—the space between leaves—which results in a much denser, lusher appearance that looks equally beautiful cascading over a shelf or sitting as a bushy centerpiece on a tabletop.To maintain the high-definition neon hues that make the Nanouk so popular, bright, indirect light is an absolute necessity. While it can tolerate lower light levels, the plant will often &#34;revert&#34; to a plain green to maximize its chlorophyll production, and its stems will stretch out in a &#34;leggy&#34; search for sun, sacrificing its compact charm. A spot near an east- or south-facing window is ideal, providing the energy it needs to produce its small, star-shaped white and yellow flowers that peek out from pink buds during the growing season. Despite its exotic appearance, it is a remarkably resilient plant, though it does have one specific quirk: its fleshy leaves are highly sensitive to standing water. When watering, it is crucial to apply moisture directly to the soil at the base of the plant rather than splashing the foliage, as trapped droplets can lead to unsightly brown spots or fungal rot. In terms of long-term care, the Nanouk thrives in a well-draining potting medium, often enriched with perlite or orchid bark to ensure the roots never sit in stagnant water. It prefers to have the top inch of its soil dry out before receiving a thorough soak. Because it is such a vigorous grower, it may require repotting annually and benefits from regular &#34;pinching&#34;—the practice of snipping off the growing tips to encourage the plant to branch out and stay full. These trimmings need not go to waste, as the Nanouk is famously easy to propagate; a simple stem cutting placed in water or directly into moist soil will typically sprout new roots within a week. This combination of &#34;Insta-worthy&#34; aesthetics and a forgiving, fast-growing nature makes it a perfect bridge plant for beginners looking to move beyond basic greenery into the world of colorful, variegated tropicals.">

          <p>I don&rsquo;t actually know where this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradescantia"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tradescantia Nanouk</a> came from&hellip; I think that we might have been given cuttings of it from the floor at Canadian Tire by a very nice old lady who was working there while we were shopping for plants. This was early on in my time with plants, maybe in the Spring of &lsquo;24(<em>?</em>), when Michelle was still teaching me how not to kill them. There are no pictures of it from early on, because it was really not doing well. We almost threw it away completely because the leaves get brown and crispy if they are touched with water, or even if it is even too humid. We have learned that it really wants to be bottom watered, and that it is almost succulent-like, only wanting water when the leaves are very flimsy to the touch. Now that I better understand this thing though (give it as much light as you can get it), it is hard to kill and it is almost too fast to grow. It is very easily chopped up and propagated directly back into soil or gifted. I don&rsquo;t like giving the cuttings to people who aren&rsquo;t pretty experienced with plants though because of my personal troubles with it at the start.</p>
