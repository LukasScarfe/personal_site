My recent research focuses on bridging the gap between high-dimensional protocols—which can carry more information per photon—and the technical simplicity required for practical, commercial hardware. We achieve this by using \u0026ldquo;qubit-like\u0026rdquo; states in a high-dimensional space, which we call Fourier-qubits (F-qubits).\nThe Problem: The Complexity of High Dimensions # Most QKD systems today operate in two dimensions (using qubits), like the polarization of light. High-dimensional (HD) QKD is attractive because it allows us to send more than one bit of information per photon and provides better tolerance against noise and eavesdropping.\nHowever, the \u0026ldquo;go-to\u0026rdquo; high-dimensional protocols require states that are superpositions of all possible values in a given dimension $d$. As $d$ increases, the experimental setup becomes exponentially more complex and prone to errors. This technical hurdle is the primary reason most commercial systems still stick to simple two-dimensional protocols.\nOur Solution: Fourier-Qubits # We introduced a protocol that uses the standard logical basis (the computational basis) but replaces the complex Fourier basis with F-qubits.\nAn F-qubit is a superposition of only two logical states, regardless of how high the dimension of the system is. The information is stored in the relative phase between these two states, which can take $d$ different values.\nWhy this works: # Simpler Hardware: Because we only ever interfere two states at a time, the measurement complexity remains constant even as the dimension grows. High Efficiency: In systems using Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs), F-qubits utilize the active area of the device much more efficiently than traditional high-dimensional states. Security: We mathematically proved that even though these states look \u0026ldquo;two-dimensional,\u0026rdquo; they can still be used to bound the information leaked to an eavesdropper in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Experimental Demonstration # To test the protocol, we built a lab-scale free-space link using the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light. We used a 4-dimensional Hilbert space where information is encoded in the \u0026ldquo;twist\u0026rdquo; of the light beam.\nThe Setup: # Source: A 633 nm laser and a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) to shape the F-qubit modes. The Channel: We simulated real-world atmospheric conditions using a turbulent cell and used an adaptive optics system (a deformable mirror) to correct the wavefront in real-time. The Result: Even with added noise, we achieved a secret key rate of 1.28 bits per photon. This is significantly higher than the theoretical limit of 1 bit per photon for standard two-dimensional systems. Key Takeaways # Our work demonstrates that you don\u0026rsquo;t need infinitely complex quantum states to reap the rewards of high-dimensional communication.\nEfficiency: We maintained the benefit of increased information density ($\\log_2(d)$ bits per photon). Robustness: The protocol remained secure and functional in a noisy, turbulent environment. Scalability: By fixing the measurement complexity to two modes, we\u0026rsquo;ve created a path for high-dimensional QKD that is actually feasible for next-generation telecommunications. Parameter Measured Value Dimension ($d$) 4 Bit Error Rate ($E_d$) 2.89% Phase Error Rate ($E_d\u0026rsquo;$) 6.91% Final Key Rate 1.28 bits/photon Conclusion # The introduction of F-qubits offers a practical \u0026ldquo;middle ground\u0026rdquo; for quantum communications. It provides the high-speed performance of high-dimensional spaces without the traditional experimental headaches. We foresee this being particularly useful in bandwidth-limited channels, such as satellite-to-ground links or fiber networks where detector recovery times usually limit speed.\n","date":"25 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/fourier-qubits/","section":"Research","summary":"We introduced ‘Fourier-qubits,’ a new class of high-dimensional quantum states that simplify the complexity of secure communication while maintaining high data rates and noise resistance.","title":"High-dimensional quantum key distribution with Qubit-like states","type":"research"},{"content":" Welcome to my personal site # Here, I document my work in Quantum Key Distribution and Quantum Optics in a more layman and casual style.

While previous work focused on cleaning up signals in real-time, this research introduces TAROQQO, a computational toolbox designed to predict when the atmosphere will be calm enough to establish a quantum key distribution channel in the first place.\nThe Challenge: The Chaotic Atmosphere # Atmospheric turbulence is the primary obstacle for free-space quantum networks. Changes in the refractive index of air cause optical signals to experience scintillation, beam wander, and wavefront distortion. These effects are quantified by the structure parameter \\(C_{n}^{2}\\).\n\u0026ldquo;Channel path. The path over which the turbulence data was collected from July 2023 to March 2024.

Knowing the turbulence strength in advance allows us to route communications through the best available channels and avoid wasting resources during \u0026ldquo;bad weather\u0026rdquo; for quantum states.\nTAROQQO: Forecasting Turbulence # We trained a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network, which we named TAROQQO (after the Italian word for tarot cards), to forecast the evolution of \\(C_{n}^{2}\\) values.\nData Collection # The network was trained on a massive dataset collected over 9 months for a 5.4 km intra-city link across the City of Ottawa.\nSender: Located at the National Research Council of Canada. Receiver: Located on the University of Ottawa campus. Inputs: We used minute-by-minute data including temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and historical turbulence values recorded by a scintillometer. Predictability # TAROQQO can output predictions up to 12 hours into the future with a time resolution as fine as one minute. In our testing (using data from February and March 2024), the network achieved a low averade deviation when comparing the predictions to the actual measured values. It is hard to quantify exactly, but if you look at the below plot, you can very nicely qualitatively see how well TAROQQO is working Predictions on one test set. Network predictions for the month from mid-February to mid-March 2024. We have our trained model forecast 6 hours in the future, then cascade individual predictions to cover one month. Jagged lines indicate missing data points from the scintillometer system. A one-hour moving average is applied to the training set to remove high-frequency noise. The scatter points refer to the raw data (before the moving average is performed). The insets show examples of individual 6-hour predictions, equally spaced throughout the month. Good performances are observed on average, with larger deviations occurring in correspondence with strong feature variations. Simulated Quantum Experiments # To prove the utility of these predictions, we simulated an 8-dimensional BB84 QKD protocol across the Ottawa channel. We compared two different ways of encoding information:\nOAM Modes: Circularly symmetric modes carrying orbital angular momentum. ANGLE Modes: A mutually unbiased basis that acts as the \u0026ldquo;Fourier-conjugate\u0026rdquo; to OAM. Key Findings # Security Thresholds: We confirmed that based on our experimental parameters, secure communication is only guaranteed in the weak-turbulence regime \\(C_{n}^{2} \\approx 10^{-16}\\). In strong turbulence \\(C_{n}^{2} \\approx 10^{-14}\\), the error rates are too high for security. Basis Robustness: Interestingly, our simulations showed that the ANGLE basis is more robust than the OAM basis during moderate turbulence because it concentrates optical power in a smaller region. This actaully confirms a secondary finding of a previous experiment Informed Decisions: By combining TAROQQO\u0026rsquo;s forecast with these simulations, a quantum network controller can predict the success rate of a key exchange before it even begins.

By predicting the \u0026ldquo;quantum weather,\u0026rdquo; we can optimize the use of time and resources, avoiding unfavorable conditions and ensuring that secure keys are only exchanged when the channel is reliable.

This work focuses on using high-speed technology to \u0026ldquo;clean up\u0026rdquo; quantum signals so they can be sent securely over long distances in the atmosphere.\nBackground: Free-Space Quantum Links # Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides a method for two parties to share secret keys with security guaranteed by the laws of physics. In essence this provides guaranteed secure communication, meaning literally nobody know what is being sent in the channel. While optical fibers are the backbone of our modern day internet, they suffer from significant signal loss over long distances when using quantum signals since they cannot be amplified without being destroyed.\nWe strongly believe that to build a global quantum network (allowing globaly unhackable communications), we must use free-space links, like ground-to-satellite communications. However, the atmosphere is a very chaotic medium. Constant changes in temperature and pressure create turbulence that distorts the phase and structure of light. If you have ever seen the stars twinkling, you have seen this in action, as the twinkle is the effect of the dim starlight being deflected on around on its way to your eyes. We want to use the spatial shape of individual photons to pack more data into every signal, but the turbulence causes different signals to overlap and become indistinguishable, resulting in high error rates.\nAdaptive Optics # We implemented a fast Adaptive Optics (AO) system to correct these distortions in real-time in a small artificial channel in our lab. We use a \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; laser beam to measure the distortions caused by turbulence in the channel at a given time. A \u0026ldquo;signal\u0026rdquo; beam carries the quantum information through the channel at the same time.\nHere is a video showing off how a wavefront sensor works from the company we purchased out AO system from:\nMeasuring Turbulence - Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SHWFS): The reference beam is sent to a SHWFS to measure the phase changes caused by turbulence. These phase changes vary spatially, and you can consider the WFS to be a camera that exchanges position information in exchange for phase information. Correcting Turbulence - Deformable Mirror: The system uses a specialized mirror with 97 actuators that can change shape over 2000 times per second to counteract the specific wavefront errors measured by the SHWFS. Key Results # Our experiments demonstrated that AO is very effective for maintaining a secure connection in turbulent environments:\nCoupling Efficiency: Without correction, turbulence reduced the average power reaching our detector to 36.6%. Activating the AO system increased this to 87.1%, providing a stable and reliable signal. Error Reduction: We measured the Quantum Dit Error Rate (QDER) across various dimensions. Without AO, the error rates were so high that secure communication was impossible for any dimension greater than d=2. System Fidelity: Through process tomography, we showed that AO restored the channel fidelity from under 50% to over 95% in most cases. Secure Key Rates: By reducing errors by an average of 32.5%, we successfully established secure communication channels that would otherwise have failed. Basis Preference: One set of modes was more robust to turbulence, but was poorly corrected by our AO system. The other was very strongly affected by turbulence, but was well corrected by the AO system. Conclusion # This work proves that advanced adaptive optics can effectively mitigate the \u0026ldquo;smearing\u0026rdquo; effect of the atmosphere on structured light. These results are a promising step toward practical, high-speed quantum networks connecting ground stations to satellites, or even establishing secure links through other turbulent mediums like water.\nA seminar where I talk about this work along with many others from the SQO research group.\n","date":"24 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/fast-ao/","section":"Research","summary":"In this work, we showed that the use of a fast adaptive optics system in a high-dimensional quantum key distribution setup allows for secure communications even in the presence of significant noise .","title":"Fast adaptive optics for high-dimensional quantum communications in turbulent channels","type":"research"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" ** 🚧 Under Construction 🚧 ** # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/travel/","section":"Lukas Scarfe","summary":"","title":"Lukas Scarfe","type":"travel"},{"content":" ** 🚧 Under Construction 🚧 ** # Download CV Contact Me Summary # I am a Physicist pursuing a doctoral degree at the university of Ottawa in the Structured Quantum Optics (SQO) research group.

After a long day of reading research papers and writing research papers, I often find it kind of hard to enjoy taking time to read even more. I do however love to read history and non-fiction specifically regarding the Classical Period in the Mediterranean.\nHere is what I am currently reading and what I have read.\n📖 Currently Reading # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e Iliad - Emily Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Translation I am slowly going through this classic. There are so very many names in the text, but I think this translation makes it super easy to read and I am not finding myself too confused at any point. The Iliad, translated by Emily Wilson \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e The Landmark Julius Caesar - Edited by Robert B. Strassler This one feels a lot like a textbook, I have been reading this for about 2 years now. Reading the words of one of the most influential men in Roman history is a very interesting experience, especially with the callous descriptions of the genocides he is commiting. It is so strange to think that these writings are pro-Caesarian propoganda and the intended audience would see the autrocities commited as a good thing. Nonetheless this is a very good read for someone interested in the time-period, and the included maps and footnotes are incredible for being able to understand things that Caesar would have assumed a Roman citizen reader would know, but I do not know. The Landmark Julius Caesar, from the Landmark Series ✅ Finished # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir \u0026mdash; Finished Oct 2025 I absolutely destroyed this book at the recommendation of Michelle. I could not stop reading once I had started. It had probably been 10 years since I last read a SciFi book. I am glad to get back to it, and I look forward to the movie coming out in 2026.

It is insanely humanizing to be able to to read the personal letters between two people that lived almost 2000 years before me. They talk about many things, Pliny looking for guidance on what to do with governance and the christians. Trajan constantly tells him that he put Pliny in charge so that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to make such decisions. In addition to these letters, I read Pliny\u0026rsquo;s firsthand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in book 6.
