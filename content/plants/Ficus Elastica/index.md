title: "Ficus Elastica"
summary: "The Ficus Elastica, commonly known as the Rubber Plant, is a robust indoor tree admired for its large, glossy leaves that possess a thick, leathery texture. These broad oval leaves emerge from a distinctive pinkish sheath and can range in color from a deep, waxy green to a dramatic \"Burgundy\" or even variegated patterns of cream and lime. Because of its sturdy upright growth habit, it serves as a sophisticated focal point in interior design while being remarkably effective at filtering indoor air."

I bought this for 5$ from Home Depot in the winter of '24. It is a slow grower, but it is consistent and has gone from real small to medium while only losing one leaf. If you don't consistently rotate this guy, he will grow off in one direction.
