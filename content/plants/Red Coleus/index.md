title: "Red Coleus"
date: 2026-01-16
summary: "There are a million varieties of Coleus plant. In low-light or shady conditions, these plants often produce more chlorophyll to capture what little light is available, causing their deep crimson or burgundy leaves to revert and develop prominent green margins or veining. This natural transformation creates a beautiful, high-contrast look that softens the plant’s appearance compared to the solid, intense reds they exhibit when grown in full sun."

There are a million varieties of [Coleus plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleus). I have no idea which one this is, I might have taken a small piece from another plant when we were at [Supercrawl](https://supercrawl.ca/) in Hamilton in the Fall of '24. These are most often annuals that people will just buy every year and keep outside, but I have found that this one really thrives being in bright light indoors. It has stuck around for a couple years now, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down. This is a great plant for propagation, every time I cut it back I end up with more than I need, and like a Hydra, for every branch that is cut, 2 grow back. It has gone from a little weed to a full on bush with a woody stem.
