summary: "The Orchid Cactus, known botanically as Epiphyllum, is a captivating tropical plant that defies the standard image of a desert-dwelling succulent. Native to the dense rainforests of Central and South America, these plants are epiphytes, meaning they grow suspended in the jungle canopy, anchoring their roots in the mossy bark and decaying organic matter of tree forks rather than in the soil. Despite their common name, they are not orchids, though they share the same tree-dwelling lifestyle. Their appearance is defined by long, flat, trailing stems that lack the harsh spines of their desert cousins, instead featuring scalloped or wavy edges that gracefully drape from hanging baskets. The true glory of the Orchid Cactus lies in its spectacular, oversized blooms, which can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. These flowers are famous for their neon-bright palette, ranging from fiery reds and electric purples to soft pinks and sunset yellows. Some species, most notably the Epiphyllum oxypetalum or \"Queen of the Night,\" are strictly nocturnal, unfurling their massive, fragrant white petals only after dusk and withering by dawn—a fleeting, moonlit performance that has gained a cult following among plant enthusiasts. In contrast, many modern hybrids have been bred to bloom during the day, offering a more enduring display of their intricate, multi-petaled geometry throughout the spring and early summer. Cultivating an Orchid Cactus requires a departure from typical cactus care. Because they are \"jungle cacti,\" they thrive in bright, filtered light rather than harsh, direct sun, which can scorch their delicate stems. They prefer a humid environment and a porous, well-draining potting medium—often a mix of peat, perlite, and orchid bark—to mimic their native arboreal habitat. Unlike desert species, they do not tolerate complete dehydration; they should be watered once the top inch of soil feels dry. A crucial \"secret\" to securing their legendary blooms is providing a cool, dry rest period during the winter months. By keeping the plant in a cooler room (around 50–55°F) and significantly reducing water for several weeks, you trigger the formation of flower buds that will erupt into a floral masterpiece as the weather warms. With their lush, cascading habit and exotic, jewel-toned blossoms, these plants offer a rewarding blend of structural drama and ethereal beauty."

I got cuttings of this [Orchid Cactus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyllum) from my Grandma in the Summer of '25. At the time we just took cuttings fromt the lanky light-deprived sections of the plant. It ha since been in prime growlight position ever since and I think it has been doing very well! I don't have pictures to compare but I think that it might be almost as big as the mother plant now. Thanks for the gift Gran :heart:.

      caption="Some parts have gone brown and crispy, I am thinking it might have a fungal infection? I haven't dealt with anything like that before, and I am hoping that maybe I just consistently overwater it. I am wondering about whether those lines on the middle leaf coming out from the nubs are indicative of flowers to come?"
