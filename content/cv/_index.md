## Summary
I am a Physicist pursuing a doctoral degree at the university of Ottawa in the [Structured Quantum Optics (SQO) research group](https://sqogroup.ca/). My research focus is quantum communications, quantum cryptigraphy, atmospheric optics, & all related quantum optics or free-space quantum cryptography topics. On the engineering side, I have experience in automation, as well as algorithm development for medical devices & scientific instrumentation using a variety of programming languages & tools. I am a strong scientific communicator with many awards for both conference talks & posters.
