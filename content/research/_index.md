Thank you for your interest in my research. I mostly do research regarding quantum information, in particular quantum communications. Most of the work that I do seeks to advance our ability to control and measure high-dimensional quantum states for increased information density and error tolerance.

    caption="**My Cumulative citations** since I started tracking them. I know that citations are not indicative of good science or a good scientist but it feels validating to be cited. It is reassuring to think that someone believes that my work is worth reading and talking about. [Source](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_eBW18oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)"
